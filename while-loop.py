#The while loop will repeat the code inside the loop until the number is guessed correctly, which is represented by the condition isGuessRight != True in the code. 
#Additionally, Python uses indentation to determine logic blocks, or what statements are considered to be part of the while loop. 
#You can indent a line by placing the cursor next to a statement and pressing TAB.
